# Team Manifesto

# What to do if two or more members are in a disagreement?
# Discuss as a group and if we don't come to a consensus, we do a majority vote. 

# What does the group do when a member is frustrated?
# The member who is frustrated should communicate his frustrations and we should have an environment conducive
# for him to express his frustrations. Our safe word is banana.

# How do we merge our code to master?
# One other team member must approve the merge.

# When does this group ask for help?
# After exhausting internet resources, if we're working on a problem for 15-20 minutes and no one can solve it, we ask for help.

# How do we pair?
# We'll start with pairs of two and we'll switch of as needed. Each pair will determine their own norms and rules of conduct.

# How does this group approach working after hours?
# Just communicate with everyone on what you are doing to make sure people aren't unknowingly working on the same thing.
